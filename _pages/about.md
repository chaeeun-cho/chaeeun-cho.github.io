Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Vanderbilt University. My research lies at the intersection of international security, international political economy, and political methodology, with a particular focus on economic coercion. In my disseration project, I investigate when and why countries cooperate on economic sanctions and analyze how firms respond to political disputes. 
Specifically, my research seeks to uncover the conditions under which countries are more likely to cooperate on imposing sanctions, as well as the strategies that governments use to encourage firms' compliance with sanctions policies.
