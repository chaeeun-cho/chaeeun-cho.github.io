Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Vanderbilt University. My research lies at the intersection of international security, international political economy, and political methodology, particularly economic coercion. My disseration investigates when and why countries cooperate on economic sanctions and how firms respond to political disputes.
