<h3> Student Comments Excerpts </h3>




<ul>
<li>Commitment to student growth
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<small> "I cannot say there is a weak point. She was very prepared for every possibility and question, and she always made sure the schedule was in order. Although she was a new instructor in
the university, it never felt like she did not know what she was doing. The team works and projects in deed helped the students to critically evaluate the topic. And the instructor really
cared for students' well beings and workload during the semester; it all made it much more interesting and comfortable to learn all the topics." (IR 331) <br>
</ul>
<ul>
"Not only she teaches our normal course syllabus, she also taught data analysis via introducing a new software. It was a very enjoyable term for me. She always helps and make things
easier. She is very compassionate about teaching something rather than just trying grade students. If you are planning to take, you will never regret your decision." (IR 331)  <br>
</ul>
<ul>
"I really enjoyed the one–on–one office hours because she explained what you could improve on in your essay outlines and it was completely tailored to what you wrote." (PSCI 1102) </small> <br>
</ul>
<ul>
"ChaeEun's email responses and feedback for assignments are very thorough and helpful.
 She is honest and wants to help students improve." (PSCI 2221) <br>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Engaging teaching style
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul> "I thought her lesson on the US and China trade wars was very engaging, and she was helpful with understanding concepts in office
hours. I don't see any major ways for her teaching to be improved." (PSCI 1102) <br>
</ul>
<ul>
"Chae did an excellent job of going through the material with examples on the board.
 With both her explaining and the examples she gave, I was able to understand how to use calculus very quickly." (Math Camp 2023)<br>
</ul>
<ul>
"Her feedback was helpful and her review sessions as well.
 Chae was well knowledged in the course material which was helpful when asking questions.
 I like that she offered the opportunity for additional help with her review sessions." (PSCI 1102) <br>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Creating supportive learning environments
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<ul>
 <small> "She is one of the best teachers I have ever seen in Bilkent. She is very kind and understanding. I am looking forward to take her other classes in next semester. Her lessons are always fun and she makes subjects easier to understand."   <br>
</ul>

<ul>
 "ChaeEun has been very helpful and patient in my learning journey. She's not only more than familiar with the concepts we learned, but also is always there to provide her own insights. The best TA I have ever met! (PSCI 3227)"  <br>
</ul>
<ul>
 "Chae was very approachable and kind. Even when discussing more complex matters, Chae created a learning environment where people felt comfortable asking questions." (Math Camp 2023)  <br>
</ul>

<ul>
"Chae was always available to help! That was the most useful tool, especially when a data analysis assignment suddenly stumped me." (PSCI 2221) <br>
</ul>
