<li><h3><strong>Leveraging Mutual Trade Partnerships: Examining the Role of Mutual Trade Partners on Sanction Imposition </strong></h3>  </li>
  How the global trade network affects the initiation of sanctions threat and its success. I argue that the shared trade partner between the potential sender and the target plays an important role in shaping the sender's ability to exercise power over the target. The sender’s ability to inflict pain on the target not only comes from the sender's trade value to the target but also the sender’s economic leverage on the shared trade partners, who can influence on the outcome of sanctions by joining sanction coalitions. Employing the Threat and Imposition of Sanctions (TIES) data set, I show that states are more likely to issue sanctions threats and sanction impositions as the sender state has greater indirect leverage over the target through the shared trade partners. Furthermore, I find that while the sender's indirect leverage is positively correlated with the target's acquiescence to sanction impositions, there is no statistically significant relationship between the sender's indirect leverage and target's acquiescence to sanction threats.

<li><h4><strong>Who Gets on Board? Exploring the Role of Trade Export Similarity in Determining Participation in Economic Sanctions </strong></h4> </li>
  This paper explores the motivations behind states joining economic sanctions. While prior literature has largely focused on economic incentives for breaking sanctions, this study highlights the potential for third-party states to join sanctions for economic reasons. Specifically, third-party states that compete with the target state for similar exports may disrupt trade to gain a competitive edge in foreign markets. By analyzing commodity-level trade data from 1962 to 2015, this study finds that countries that share similar export portfolios with the target are more likely to join sanctioning coalitions.

<li><h4><strong>Standing Firm or Caving In? The Effect of State Control and Foreign Policy Preferences on Firms’ Exit Decisions </strong>[Research Design Stage]</h4> 
 </li>

Why do some multinational corporations (MNCs) comply with economic sanctions while others continue to conduct their business with the target states? I argue that the ownership structure of firms and the foreign policy preferences of their home country are essential factors in understanding firms' decision to exit from targeted countries in response to economic sanctions. I use newly collected data on firm ownership as well as foreign policy similarity based on United Nations voting data to estimate the effect of political relations on firms’ exit decision from Russia. I expect that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are less likely to exit from the target country than private enterprises when their home country shares a close foreign policy preference with the target country. Conversely, SOEs are more likely to exit from the target country than private enterprises when their home country's foreign policy preference is distant from the target country.
